This repository contains some of the projects I completed during my Master's Degree in Visual Arts at IUAV, Venice.

### (Random) Mechanical Orchestra
The project was inspired by a Joe Jones' performance, called **Mechanical Orchestra**. It consists in following some simple instructions to create a different audio track at each execution of the program. 

Instructions to test it:
- open the `index.html` file inside the folder with any app able to run HTML code (e.g. Brackets)
- run the script
- click on "Start" to start the session
- click on "Stop" or kill the execution when you do not want to hear to it anymore
- (optional) click on "Start" any time you want to start another session
